# Movie Recommender System

Implementation of a movie recommender system using content based filtering and collaborative filtering together.

This project is done for the machine learning course, Shahid Beheshti University, Fall-2022.

## Description:
* Feature Engineerings are done in the file `Feature_Engineering.ipynb`. This script cleans raw given dataFram and saves cleaned daraFram.
* `Recommender_System.ipynb` contains both content-based and collaborative filtering algorithms implementation.
* The final output of code comes from `recommend()` function. This function use both alorithms to calculate final results.

## How to run:
1. You can download the dataset from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1W3-WEplVSztLR3lvkyYdiKZGMT4y0cNi/view?usp=sharing). Extract downloaded file and put `IMDB` directory next to the notebooks.
2. run `Feature_Engineering.ipynb` file.
3. run `Recommender_System.ipynb` file.
